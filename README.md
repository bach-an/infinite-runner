# infinite-runner
A Unity remake of my Graphics class' final project with some extra features and changes from the original.
The project can be downloaded and built in unity. I didn't want to include the build files or make an installer because truthfully, I'm not sure who will play this.

Changes:
  - There are no longer two simultaneous views of the player. Players can switch perspectives by pressing 'p'.
  - Platforms have variable height now.
  - Platforms do not have the cobblestone texture.
  - There is no starting spot light.

Additions:
  - There is UI to keep track of score and height.
  - Platforms move.
  - Platform generation animation has changed.
  - There is now a start and pause menu.
  - Players can move left/right.
  - Mouse look.
